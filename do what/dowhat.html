Place a Prang-16 Semi-Moist Watercolor set right next the bristle sheet. 
<br/>
Grab a paint brush and dip it in water. 
<br/>
With that same paint brush, choose any color that is expressing your emotion with any size brush,
<br/>
Paint the box as large or as small as you want.
<br/>
<Br/>

Without cleaning your brush, dab your brush in the color that is on the right side of the last color you choose. 
<br/>
Paint an “X” if you ever fell in love before, 
<br/>
Paint an “O” if not. 
<Br/>
<Br/>
Clean your brush.
